{"deck":"USH_ConstitutionL3","term":"gerrymandering","content":"redistricting for political purposes\n\nyou can also gerrymander to draw districts in minority regions where the minority becomes the majority in that region (since the gerrymandered region does not contain any of the big majority opinion but rather ONLY minority region)\n\nthe political part of gerrymandering: you gerrymander to your party because if you didnâ€™t and you drew districts evenly like subdividing a square, then each district would still retain the same political makeup of the state as a whole; if you gerrymandered and divided the state so that one district would consist of people heavily favoring one party over another, then that district would differ from the political makeup of the state as a whole\n\nLore:\nelbridge gerry wanted to make sure he got reelected every year (he was in the house of representatives)\nhe made sure that when they redrew boundaries they would redraw the boundary that he represented in areas where he knew that he would pick up votes; his district looked like a key in the middle of mass lmao"}
