{"deck":"USH_ConstitutionL4","term":"How are electors chosen?","content":"At first, people of a state were chosen to go sit together and discuss election, but now the parties have taken over that process\n\nWithin each party, a slate of electors is created\n\tin mass, 11 electors: democrats choose 11 and republicans choose 11\nthis creates a slate of democrats and a slate of republicans\n\nIf we went along the numbers of the popular vote, we would normally divide among the electors and give the democratic electors 11 and the republicans 4 electors\n\t(based on general dominance of parties in MA (democrats are bigger))\nTHAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS; all but 2 states are all-or-nothing states\n\tin the case of MA which is an all-or-nothing state, so if democrats win, their whole slate of electors will go to the electoral college\n\n(side note) When you vote, you are checking boxes of electorsâ€™ names but really you are voting on the party cuz they are then going to the electoral college and voting on that official\n\nTwo oddballs: Maine and Nebraska\nMaine has 4 electrons and has divided its state into 3 electoral districts. Each district has 1 vote and the overall winner of the state gets the fourth elector.","newTerm":""}
