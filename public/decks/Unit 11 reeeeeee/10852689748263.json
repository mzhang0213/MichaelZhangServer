{"deck":"Unit 11 reeeeeee","term":"failure of Cotton Diplomacy","content":"Britain had abolished slavery decades ago\nSouth tried to bring them into the war on their side at battle of Antietam\nthe lower classes in britain did not like the upper class, creating a split in Britain view of US in the first place\nbut anyway, reasoning:\n\tthey needed foreign help just like americans needed it in Am Rev\n\tthe upper classes in Britain like the american south\n\tsouth thought they would have a good shot with Britain cuz 75% of GB cotton came from the South :pog:\n\nwhy did cotton diplomacy fail?\n1. between 1857 and 1860, cotton exports out of south became so poggers/efficient that the excess began being stored in British warehouses. WHEN north began blocking southern ports and thus their exports, it would make sense that britain might have been irritated BUT they could just fall back on their storage and everything would be jazzy for them\n2. if britain couldn't get southern cotton, they could just mosey on over to another place (egypt, india, etc) and yoink some of their cotton\n3. !! BIGGEST FACTOR when british surpluses begin to dwindle, LINCOLN RELEASES EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION\n\nflowtree:\nsouth needs help > south looks to britain since good trade partners > south totally sidestepped and eventually shit on by lincoln :EZ:","newTerm":""}
