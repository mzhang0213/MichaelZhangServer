{"deck":"USH_ConstitutionL1","term":"Weakness of the ConfedGov (Foreign)","content":"Foreign Relations:\n\t1.   treaty of paris\n\t-even though we've been good with making treaties, we blundered here\n\t-the british said that they will evacuate states will “all convenient speed” but this term is so ambiguous and vague\n\t\t-the british just wouldn’t really leave and forcing them would send them into war again\n\t-british also said that they wouldn’t leave until loyalist properties were paid for\n\t\t-property rights are very important\n\t\t-loyalists are in essence british people\n\n\t2.   trade reestablishing\n\t-the british wanted to start trading again with the colonists but they prevented colonists from trading in british territories such as the british west indies\n\t-at the same time, they also came into the colonies and started spreading around their goods in the colonies\n\t\t-bad since these goods were often cheaper and better made than colonist goods and they were putting colonists out of businesses\n\t\t-colonists needed to prevent the british and their goods from coming in and taking the market but one-state veto prevented tariffs\n\t-the spanish threatened colonists access to the new orleans port and prevented them from using the port, making shipping goods really hard\n\t-spanish stopped american expansion by arming the native americans so that they could fend them off\n\n\t3.   economic troubles\n\t-pirates: the Barbary Pirates harassed shipping lanes in and out across the Mediterranean which was a big problem for the colonists\n\t\tthese pirates would take bribes to leave them alone and the british would pay those bribes because they could afford to\n\t\tno british means no one to pay bribes\n\t-inability to tax: there was no money!!\n\t\tways of raising revenue: auctioning land, loans and borrowing money, requesting money from the states, issue bonds (problem: inflation)\n\t-state tariff wars\n\t\tstates were given control of commerce and were able to issue tariffs\n\t\tif they needed revenue or control of their economy they could issue tariffs\n\t\t\toccurred between VA and MD and resulted in prices to increase, trade decrease, and overall economy tanking\n\t\tcouldn't be changed (like states rights) because of one-state veto\n\tsettling these state tariff wars is a part of what starts the constitution"}
