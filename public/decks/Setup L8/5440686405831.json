{"deck":"Setup L8","term":"War with Tripoli","content":"jefferson is going to take the navy that adams built up in safety prep for the war with france out for a spin\nwhen the tripoli pirates attacked one of our ships, we didn’t declare war but we sent our navy thing to them\nthe pasha of tripoli declared war with us and chopped down our flag over the embassy\n\none of the ships - USS philly, a frigate - was captured with like 300 sailors on board\nsolution: look to Lt. Stephen Decatur\nwe looked to this guy to lead this commando operation\nplan: blow up and burn as many ships as possible in the port of tripoli\n\tit was also, however, kinda a suicide mission; they didn’t expect to survive\nhe went to his own crew, the USS Enterprise, and all of his men stepped up to go\nthey set fire and blew up all of the ships in the harbor and got out and were successful\n\nthis forced the pasha of tripoli to make a deal: US would pay $60000 ransom to get our sailors back, and they would stop harassing our ships\n\nwe did show them but there were other barbary nations that we would still have to deal with until the war of 1812 xD","newTerm":""}
