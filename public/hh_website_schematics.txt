food ordering schematic
OK THIS IS SUPER COMPLICATED AND MAYBE DONT MAKE

pizza_person-side:
wworker receives order > disp as order with the name, items (ie token count), time_placed. put call button and done button under the info
onclick: grow, dim bg, show the food as a series of panels popping out on the right of the main panel
also include a place to mark food items gone / missing / finished

client-side:
menu options as panels, onhover grow, big shadows
order credits in the top right of the page
click on item, darken bg, grow even more, have an order button w/ how many creds you want to spend (1cred=1unit)
onsubmit > post to server.js > send data to pizza_person-side's wworker
