-when you delete folder and no notes left, it menas folder is getting deleted
	-ALERT WHEN THIS CASE HAPPENS
	DONE DONE DONE
-when you create folder, prompt user with folder name > create tab > switch to that folder tab > alert ("what do you want first note to be called in this folder?")
	DONE DONE DONE
SO ACTUALLY SCRAP THE IDEA OF "new folder" CUZ IT IS ALL BUILT INTO NOTES
-this is actually shit design but idc
	DONE DONE DONE
